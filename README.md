READ ME:
========
Open index.html in Chrome or FireFox to access the website.
The assignment was difficult but it should satisfy the rubric. 
I was originally going to submit without addressing my lack of 
vue.js apps, but my pride got the best of me and I've decided to 
fess up to it.

I have done a dishonorable thing; I have intentionally done 
everything in vanilla.js since I knew it better than Vue.js 
and I was unwilling to put in the time to master Vue.js. 
Rest assured that the website should still satisfy the 
requirements, but I do not completely feel like I 
accomplished the requirements of the assignment. 
How this is graded is left up to you: do with it what you must.
